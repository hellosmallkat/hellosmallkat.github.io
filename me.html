  <h1>Who <em>I</em> am </h1>
  <body>
  <p> I am currently a freshman at the University of Rhode Island as a double major.
      The double majors I am pursuing are Chinese and computer since. 
      I am learning the Chinese flagship program at my school. 
      I am currently doing 19 credits this semester. 
      I enjoy running, dancing and photography.
